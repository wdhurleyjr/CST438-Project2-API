## MongoDB Atlas Backup Strategy

### Automated Backup Setup

MongoDB Atlas provides a built-in backup mechanism to ensure your database is securely backed up. Follow these steps to enable automatic backups:

1. Log in to your [MongoDB Atlas account](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).
2. Navigate to your cluster, and select the **Backups** tab.
3. Configure **Automated Snapshots** to run daily or weekly, with retention policies to retain backups for a defined period (e.g., 7 days for daily, 30 days for weekly).
4. MongoDB Atlas will automatically manage the backups and provide options for restore when needed.

### Manual Backup Process

To perform a manual backup:

1. Navigate to the **Backups** tab of your MongoDB cluster.
2. Click on **Create Snapshot** to perform an on-demand backup of your current database state.

### Restore Process

To restore a backup from MongoDB Atlas:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab of your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. Select the desired backup snapshot from the available list.
3. Click on **Restore**, and follow the prompts to restore it to either the current cluster or a new one.

Alternatively, you can **download a backup** for local storage and restore it manually.

### Heroku Integration

No special Heroku integration is needed, as MongoDB Atlas handles the backups and restores independently of Heroku.
